## Fully or Partially Implemented

- Vectors
- AVL-Balanced Binary Search Trees
- Singly Linked Lists
- Hash Tables
- Matrices

## Semantics

- Data structures are represented as structs
- "Methods" on data structures are stored as function pointers in struct
- Favour returning NULL on error

## TODO

### Data Structures

* [x] Type-agnostic dynamic arrays (vectors)
* [x] Linked lists
* [x] Hash tables
* [ ] Queues, deques
* [x] Binary trees
* [ ] N-ary trees
    * [ ]   - Tries?
* [ ] Graphs
* [x] Matrices and vectors

### Algorithms

- Binary search
- BFS, DFS
- Linear algebra
    - Matrix operations
    - Convolution
