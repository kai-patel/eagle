# Eagle

**A Standard Library for C**

## Partially Implemented

- Vectors
- Binary Search Trees
- Singly Linked Lists

## Semantics

- Data structures represented as structs
- "Methods" on data structures stored as function pointers in struct
- Return NULL on error

## TODO

### Data Structures

- Type-agnostic dynamic arrays (vectors)
- Linked lists
- Hash tables
- Queues, deques
- Binary trees
- N-ary trees
    - Tries?
- Graphs
- Matrices and vectors

### Algorithms

- Binary search
- BFS, DFS
- Linear algebra
    - Matrix operations
    - Convolution
