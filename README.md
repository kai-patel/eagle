[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/badc3452ea2843b09ca0f2ff9cd74ca0)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/kai-patel/eagle?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=kai-patel/eagle&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

**A Standard Library for C**

## Fully or Partially Implemented

- Vectors
- AVL-Balanced Binary Search Trees
- Singly Linked Lists
- Hash Tables

## Semantics

- Data structures are represented as structs
- "Methods" on data structures are stored as function pointers in struct
- Favour returning NULL on error

## TODO

### Data Structures

- Type-agnostic dynamic arrays (vectors)
- Linked lists
- Hash tables
- Queues, deques
- Binary trees
- N-ary trees
    - Tries?
- Graphs
- Matrices and vectors

### Algorithms

- Binary search
- BFS, DFS
- Linear algebra
    - Matrix operations
    - Convolution
